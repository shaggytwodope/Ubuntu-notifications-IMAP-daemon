IMAP Push notifications for Ubuntu phone

A simple daemon. Run it on a permanently-on server of your choice with "python daemon.py".
It will pair with the Caxton app on your phone, and then monitor your email account (with IMAP IDLE) and send a notification when you get new mail. No waiting for the phone to poll any more!
